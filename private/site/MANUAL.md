### Practical Guide to Editing Texts, Images and Comments in HTML - Landing Page

# Introduction

>In this eBook, you will learn the basics of editing HTML text, images and comments. HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the fundamental language for creating web pages and allows you to structure and format content efficiently.

1. Editing non-HTML Texts

> Texts in HTML are defined using different markup elements. Here are some examples:

1. 1 Titles and Paragraphs

<h1>This is a main title</h1>
<h2>This is a subtitle</h2>
<p>This is an example paragraph.</p>



1. 2 Bold, Italics and Underlining

<p><b>Bold text</b></p>
<p><i>Text in italics</i></p>
<p><u>Underlined text</u></p>



1. 3 Lists
<ul>
    <li>Item 1</li>
    <li>Item 2</li>
</ul>

<ol>
    <li>Item numbered 1</li>
    <li>Item numbered 2</li>
</ol>



2. Editing Images in HTML

Images are inserted using the tag <img>. Example:

<img src="/images/imagem.jpg" alt="Image description">



3. Adding and Editing Comments in HTML
Comments are used to document the code and are not displayed in the browser. To add a comment, use:
<!-- This is a comment -->

3. 1 Commenting Part of the Code
We can use comments to temporarily disable part of the code:
<!-- <p>This paragraph is commented and will not be displayed.</p> -->


# Conclusion
> This eBook presented the essential concepts for editing texts, images and comments in HTML. With this knowledge, you are ready to customize your web pages efficiently.
